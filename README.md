# Subanalytics

Subanalytics is a predictive analytics tool for SaaS businesses. It takes customer data from businesses in the form of CSV files and analyzes it to predict churn rate, identify the top-three customers with the highest churn probability, and show subscription plan distribution. It then generates actionable insights using a custom-built prediction model paired with NVIDIA’s LLaMA 3.1 Nemotron 70B Instruct language model to help reduce churn and improve business growth and customer retention.

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
TOKEN_EXPIRY=1d
PORT=5000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173  # or your frontend URL
```

---

#### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000  # or your backend URL
```

---

#### 4. Flask Microservice Setup

```bash
cd ../flask-backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the microservice
python app.py
```

Create a `.env` file in the `flask-backend/` directory:

```env
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_llama_nemotron_api_key
```

## 🚀 Usage

Once the app is running locally:

### 1. **Sign Up / Login**

* Navigate to the frontend (usually at `http://localhost:5173`)
* Register a new account or log in with existing credentials
* Authentication is handled securely using JWTs (access and refresh tokens)

### 2. **Upload Customer Data**

* After logging in, head to the dashboard
* Upload your customer data as a CSV file
* The file is sent to the backend and processed

### 3. **Get Predictions**

* The backend forwards the data to the Flask microservice
* A custom **scikit-learn** model predicts:

  * Overall churn rate
  * Top 3 customers at risk of churning
  * Subscription plan distribution

### 4. **AI-Powered Insights**

* The prediction results are passed to **NVIDIA LLaMA 3.1 Nemotron 70B**
* Business insights and actionable suggestions are generated
* Insights focus on churn reduction, retention strategies, and growth

### 5. **Visual Dashboard**

* View data breakdowns and charts powered by **Chart.js**
* See churn metrics, at-risk users, and subscription segmentation
* Use this data to inform business decisions
